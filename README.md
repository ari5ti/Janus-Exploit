# Janus Vulnerability (CVE-2017-13156) Exploit with Proof-of-Concept(POC)

Android package installer does not check extra data before PKZIP, thus we can concat DEX & APK together with little bit og fix to pass the installation.

ART can run both APK and DEX, so here DEX ahead of base.apk is actually the one to execute.

    extract the original classes.dex from apk
    use APKTOOL to do stuffs on it
    Inject the new dex into original APK
    update the installed app :)

Exploit is used to inject our dex file into apk
