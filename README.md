Android package installer does NOT check extra data before PKZIP, thus we can concat DEX & APK together with little bit of fix to pass the installation.

ART can run both APK and DEX, so here DEX ahead of base.apk is actually the one to execute.

    extract the original classes.dex
    use APKTOOL to do stuffs on it
    fuse the new dex into original APK
    update the installed app :)
